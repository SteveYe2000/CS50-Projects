Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

10, 100 and 1000 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After 10000 simulations round the results became consistent therefore one can conclude
that 10000 simulations would be good enough.
